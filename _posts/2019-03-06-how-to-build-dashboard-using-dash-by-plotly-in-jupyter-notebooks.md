One of the promises I made myself at the start of 2019 was that I would finish learning one new tech or one online course per month. I have already started the Machine Learning course by Tom Mitchell in January (you can find my online notes here) and still going on. For the month of February, I wanted to learn something less exhaustive and chose 'Interactive Python Dashboards with Plotly and Dash".

Data visualization is a quick and easy way to convey the message universally. If you are looking for a way to visualize your data and share it with others, [Dash] is an excellent option. With about 100 lines of code, I built an interactive dash to analyze time series data for a financial service company. Written on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, Dash is ideal for building data visualization apps with highly custom user interfaces in pure Python. Through a couple of simple patterns, Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols required to build an interactive web-based application, making this framework particularly suited for anyone who works with data in Python. It supports the OAuth authentication to secure the dashboards as well.

## What is the difference between Matplotlib, Plotly, and Dash?
=> Matplotlib: Static Visualisation
=> Plotly: Animated visualization, generated in a file (e.g. HTML)
=> Dash: Real-Time animated visualization

I highly recommend Plotly as a visualization toolkit. Well, I will be giving up Matplotlib and taking up Plotly for a very long period of time now!
